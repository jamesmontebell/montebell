			As an aspiring lifelong learner, my educational goals revolve around my love for technology.
			Ever since I was a child, I have been drawn to computers, especially video games. This
			fascination quickly turned into a passion for problem-solving and coding, and I am eager to
			continue honing my skills in this field. My ultimate professional goal is to work alongside a
			team of like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology. Together, we will work
			towards a common goal, harnessing our individual skills to achieve greatness. Above all, I
			want to wake up every day happy and fulfilled, doing what I love most - working with
			technology.

			In addition to my passion for technology, I have a strong enthusiasm for fitness. I thoroughly
			enjoy working out and maintaining an active lifestyle as I firmly believe that fitness is the
			cornerstone of success. Apart from that, I have a keen interest in anime, cats, and music.
